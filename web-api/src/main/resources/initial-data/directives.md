Directives allow implementing custom HTML elements or adding more functionality to existing elements.

  - `directives/active-on-location.js` is a simple directive that simply toggles a CSS class on element
    based on the current URL. It is used for the top navigation.
  - `directives/blog-post.js` implements displaying posts along with inline editing and deleting.
  - `directives/epic-editor.js` wraps a third-party component so that it integrates smoothly with Angular.
