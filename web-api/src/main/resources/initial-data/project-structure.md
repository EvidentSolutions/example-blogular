Blogular has two modules:

  - `frontend` is a static frontend application using AngularJS.
  - `web-api` is a [Spring](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) application which provides
    JSON APIs for the frontend to use.

When developing, you can run the two modules separately and then bundle everything into one Java
application for deployment.
